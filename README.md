Langton's Ant Adventures - a homemade logical puzzle game

Langton's Ant Adventures is a logical puzzle game I created within a 48 hours timeframe of a MiniGameJam  - a tiny game development competition. 
You can download the game for Windows or a linux-based OS. 
Help the little ant achieve its objetives while learning about the first cell automata.
